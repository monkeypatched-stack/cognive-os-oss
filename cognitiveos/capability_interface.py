"""Capability Interface — Uniform execution interface for all runtime capabilities.

This module defines the ICapability interface that all capabilities must implement.
Every capability transforms execution state and contributes to policy learning.

Key Principles:
- Every capability implements the same interface
- All capabilities are treated identically by the runtime
- No privileged execution stages
- Every capability augments execution state
- Every capability contributes policy observations
- Bellman selects capabilities, not pipelines
