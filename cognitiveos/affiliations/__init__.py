"""Actor-Centric Affiliation Architecture.

TrustEngine is the single trust abstraction used by both
SocietyRuntime (actor-to-actor) and AffiliationManager (affiliation trust).

Each affiliation type is a semantic concept with metadata:
    - category (personal, organizational, etc.)
    - cardinality (how many-to-many)
    - bidirectionality
    - default permissions
    - trust model (growth/decay rates)
    - lifecycle rules (creation, expiration, dissolution)
