"""Core Ontology — the stable, versioned foundation.

~160 concepts organized into categories:
    World    — what exists (16 types)
    Actor    — what actors are (17 types)
    Cognition — goals (24 types) + beliefs (14 types)
    Social   — affiliations/relationships (21 types)
    Capability — what actors can do (21 types)

Domain extensions (healthcare, manufacturing, etc.) extend this
core without modifying it.
